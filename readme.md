 25 days of coding challenges.
https://adventofcode.com/2023

I'm doing this because I think they're fun. 
I might not be doing it the best possible way to practice things such as stdin,unittests, and classes. 
Sometimes I add mini challenges just to see if i can all for practice.
I plan on optimizing them all to O(n) when I'm done or if i have spare time. I'm hoping this will get me to write better notes and will help me practice diving into code I didnt write that day.
